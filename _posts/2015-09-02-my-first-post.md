This is basically my first post. Starting off with the basic jekyll hosted on github with a docker container for building / serving it locally.

## An introduction
Just last night I dreamt about writing an awesome blogpost on something really cool. I just can't really remember what it was about, but it did push me over the edge to actually start my blog. I've tried it before, but that didn't work out, so now with this new vision as i dreamt it last night, let's see what happens.

I'm one of the two founders of [Kingsquare BV](https://www.kingsquare.nl) a small webagency in The Netherlands. We started out a [decade ago](https://web.archive.org/web/20020929153106/http://www.kingsquare.nl/) (i know, seems like forever in internet years) and have always had an engineers point of view to a problem. Let's dive into the entrepreneurship details on a later date.
I like to build stuff. That's basically me. Think / build / deliver would be my tag line I guess. Doesnt mean I have no other life than sitting behind a desk writing programs, but it does mean that I don't like fussing about layouts, colours and `how would my cat use this` type of issues. Lets make it work and then have someone else worry about marketing, visuals or UI... 

## Important stuff for me
I'm a husband and father (of 2 boys) but beyond that I read _alot_ of RSS feeds, do my day-to-day work in a [Linux environment](http://www.ubuntu.com/) and try to integrate [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) into as much as i can. (more on all of this later)

So in closing: lets get this show on the road! (and if you have questions, leave me a note [here](robin@oldboyz.net), [here](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/robinspeekenbrink) or [here](http://stackoverflow.com/users/237750) or Twitter or something :))
